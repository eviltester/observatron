# Observatron

A prototype exploratory testing observation tool for Chrome browser.

This is an under-development Chrome plugin.

To install:

- download the files
- visit chrome://extensions
- switch on Developer mode
- Load unpacked
- choose the 'chrome' folder (the one with the manifest in it)

To use:

- Click the red button [Engage the Observatron] to start
- you might need to refresh the page at the moment
- the button will turn green
- Click the green button [Disengage the observatron] to finish

As you browse and test, you will see files download.

These will be in a `\observatron` folder in your downloads folder.

You will see screenshots and .mhtml files.

- screenshots are taken when you load a page, and when you scroll
- `.mhtml` files are extracted when you load a page

`.mhtml` files can be opened in a browser and are the packaged css, and html of the page at the time.

screenshots are what was shown on the screen.

Still buggy. Work in progress.
